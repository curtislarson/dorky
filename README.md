Experimenting with python and Google/Github/pastebin 'dorks'

Goals:

- Automatically identify information such as api keys, login credentials,
other stuff that accidently gets put into code segments pasted to the internet.

- Attempt to contact person involved and get them to fix it (Github)

- Expand to encompass some sort of plugin / new dork you can add that
enables to check for something new over the different scopes of searches.

- Use python class / recommended program structure in order to improve one's
own knowledge of python
